# Tweet Sentiment Classification

This project aims to classify tweets into sentiment categories using machine learning models. It leverages the Sentiment140 dataset to train models that can automatically detect sentiment from text data, providing valuable insights for social media analytics.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. This classification aids businesses and developers in understanding public opinion and tailoring content accordingly.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **NLTK**: For text processing and sentiment analysis.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For generating visualizations.

## Project Structure

- `/data`: Contains the dataset files.
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.
- `/scripts`: Python scripts for model training and evaluation.
- `/figures`: Saved plots and figures from analyses.
